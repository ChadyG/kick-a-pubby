            You are a pubby and have no access to the kick command.  You must be a member of the Something Awful forums and a member of the Lost Continents Steam group to be not a pubby.
            Our list is sometimes out of date by up to an hour.  This will not affect your protection from being kicked, only your ability to kick others.
